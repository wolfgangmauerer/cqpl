# Communication-capable quantum programming language (cQPL)

Quantum programming language as described by Wolfgang Mauerer in "Semantics and
simulation of communication in quantum programming"
([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0511145) / [pdf](http://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0511145v1.pdf)).

Builds on top of Bernhard Oemer's [QCL](http://tph.tuwien.ac.at/~oemer/qcl.html)


## Quick Setup

1. Clone repository and `cd` into the directory
2. Run `sh install.sh`

To verify that it is working try the cointoss example with
```
cd cqpl
./qpl coin_toss.qpl
```
